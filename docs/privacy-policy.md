# Privacy Policy

Last updated September 20, 2025

Yujiro Takeda has developed the Prompt History as a Freemium application. This SERVICE is provided by Yujiro Takeda at no cost and is intended for use "as is."

This Privacy Policy outlines how your information is collected, used, and disclosed when using the Service. By choosing to use the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. The Personal Information collected is utilized solely for providing and enhancing the Service. Your information will not be shared with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as defined in our Terms and Conditions, accessible at Selection Command, unless otherwise specified.

## Information Collection and Use

- **Prompt and Edit Data**: Any prompts entered by the user and related editing information are managed solely on the user's local device and are not transmitted to external servers, except when the optional Prompt Improver feature is used (see below).

- **Prompt Improver Feature (Optional)**: This application offers an optional feature that uses the Gemini API to improve prompts. When you choose to use this feature:
  - You must provide your own Gemini API key, which is stored locally on your device
  - Your prompt text is sent to Google's Gemini API for processing when you explicitly use the improve function
  - **Important**: If you use a free Gemini API key, Google may use your submitted prompts to improve their products and services, including machine learning technologies. If you use a paid Gemini API key, your prompts will not be used for product improvement.
  - Your use of the Gemini API is subject to [Google's Gemini API Terms of Service](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms)
  - We do not store, process, or have access to the content you send to the Gemini API. All data is transmitted directly between your device and Google's servers.

- **User Activity**: This application utilizes third-party services to track anonymous usage data, such as which options or buttons are most frequently clicked. User Activity data collected is used solely for feature improvement and bug resolution. It will never be used for any other purposes.
